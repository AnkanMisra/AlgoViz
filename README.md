# SortViz

**SortViz** is a tool designed to visually demonstrate the time complexity of various sorting algorithms. This project provides an educational resource for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different sorting methods through clear and intuitive visualizations.

## Features

- **Visualize Time Complexity**: Shows how different sorting algorithms perform on various input sizes.
- **Support for Multiple Algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Radix Sort
  - Bucket Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Shell Sort
  - Counting Sort
- **Logarithmic Scale Representation**: Accurately depicts the time complexity of sorting algorithms using a logarithmic scale.
- **Graphs and Heatmaps**: Includes a variety of visualizations such as line charts and heatmaps to offer different perspectives on algorithm performance.

## Installation

To run the visualizations locally, you'll need to have Java and Python installed on your machine.

### Java

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnkanMisra/AlgoViz.git
   cd AlgoViz
  
2. Compile and run
   ```bash
    java sort.java

3. The data will be stored to the sorting_times.csv file

4. Install these packages
    ```bash
   pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
5. Run the Command
  ```bash
python3 visual.py
